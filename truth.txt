Everything worth doing takes time, and more time than you think, and definitely more time than you hope it will.
But I’ve also learned that if you think something is taking a long time, it means you’re getting somewhere. It means you’re on the right track. Good things don’t move fast,
and they sure as hell don’t move easily.

While you’re climbing your mountain, forget the blind pursuit of success for a second.
Instead, focus on the bigger picture; it’s not a straight line that starts at the beginning and ends at the top. Every new venture is one long learning curve,
full of growth, relationships and exciting new opportunities, most of which is far more rewarding than the success you are chasing.
Maximize and extract everything you can along the way, and remember that success comes to those who stick around long enough to earn it.
